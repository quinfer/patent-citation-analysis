# Network-Based Patent Innovation Analysis: Methodology and Economic Foundations

## Abstract
This document outlines a comprehensive methodology for analyzing technological innovation through patent citation networks. Following Funk & Owen-Smith (2017), we develop measures of technological disruption that capture both the magnitude and nature of innovative activity. Our approach combines network analysis, temporal patterns, and citation structures to create economically meaningful measures of technological change.

## Intuition
The CDt index characterizes how future inventions
make use of the technological predecessors cited by a
focal patent. Our intuition is that citations of prede-
cessors should decrease after a destabilizing invention
is introduced because the technology entails a break
with past ways of thinking. By contrast, consolidating
inventions should be cited together with their prede-
cessors and therefore increase citations of technologies
on which they build. The networks in the bottom left
and right panels of Figure 1 in Funk & Owen-Smith (2017) illustrate this idea.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Theoretical Foundation
The measurement of technological innovation presents significant empirical challenges. Traditional measures like R&D spending or patent counts fail to capture the qualitative nature of innovation. Our methodology addresses this by analyzing the structure of knowledge flows through citation networks, providing insights into:

1. Technological trajectory changes
2. Knowledge recombination patterns
3. Innovation diffusion speeds
4. Cross-field knowledge spillovers

### 1.2 Economic Intuition
Our measures proxy several economically relevant phenomena:

1. **Creative Destruction**: Through disruption of existing knowledge networks
2. **Knowledge Spillovers**: Via citation patterns across technological fields
3. **Innovation Quality**: Through network position and citation structure
4. **Technological Life Cycles**: Via temporal citation patterns

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Citation Network Analysis

#### Network Position Metrics
We construct several measures that proxy different aspects of technological influence:

1. **Forward Connections** (FC)
```python
FC = unique_citing_patents
```
*Economic Intuition*: Proxies the breadth of technological influence and market impact

2. **Network Density** (ND)
```python
ND = total_citations / (citing_patents * cited_patents)
```
*Economic Intuition*: Measures the intensity of knowledge flows and technology adoption

3. **K5 Diversity Score**
```python
k5 = f(patent_distribution, temporal_spread, connection_ratio)
```
*Economic Intuition*: Captures the generality of innovation and potential for spillovers

### 2.2 Pure F Score: Knowledge Flow Quality

The Pure F score measures the quality and efficiency of knowledge transmission:

```python
Pure_F = Temporal_Factor * Network_Factor * Quality_Factor
```

#### Component Economic Interpretation

1. **Temporal Factor**
- Proxies: Speed of knowledge diffusion
- Economic Significance: Market responsiveness and adoption rates
- Interpretation: Higher values indicate faster knowledge absorption

2. **Network Factor**
- Proxies: Knowledge flow efficiency
- Economic Significance: Information transmission costs
- Interpretation: Higher values suggest lower friction in knowledge transfer

3. **Quality Factor**
- Proxies: Innovation relevance
- Economic Significance: Knowledge utilization efficiency
- Interpretation: Higher values indicate more effective knowledge application

### 2.3 Disruption Indices

#### Traditional Disruption Index (DI)
```python
DI = (j5 + i5 + k5) / 3
```

*Economic Components*:
1. **j5**: Forward impact
   - Proxies: Market value creation
   - Interpretation: Future technological relevance

2. **i5**: Development speed
   - Proxies: Innovation cycle time
   - Interpretation: Market responsiveness

3. **k5**: Citation diversity
   - Proxies: Generality of innovation
   - Interpretation: Spillover potential

#### Modified Disruption Index (mDI)
```python
mDI = j5 * (1 + i5) * (1 + k5)
```

*Economic Interpretation*:
- Captures complementarities between components
- Rewards balanced innovation profiles
- Penalizes one-dimensional advances

## 3. Mathematical Framework

### 3.1 Network Representation

Let G_t = (V_t, E_t) represent the citation network at time t, where:
- V_t: set of patents
- E_t: set of citations between patents

For each patent i ∈ V_t:
```python
F_i = {j ∈ V_t | (j,i) ∈ E_t}  # Forward citations
B_i = {j ∈ V_t | (i,j) ∈ E_t}  # Backward citations
```

### 3.2 Core Metrics Formalization

#### 3.2.1 Network Position Metrics
```python
# Forward Connections (FC)
FC_i = |F_i|

# Network Density (ND)
ND_i = |E_i| / (|V_i| * (|V_i| - 1))
where E_i = {(j,k) ∈ E_t | j,k ∈ N_i}  # Edges in i's neighborhood
      N_i = F_i ∪ B_i  # i's network neighborhood

# K5 Diversity Score
k5_i = Σ_j∈F_i (1/|F_j|)  # Forward diversity
```


#### 3.2.2 Pure F Score Components
```python
Pure_F_it = temporal_factor_it * network_factor_i * quality_factor_i

where:
temporal_factor_it = m_it / n_it
m_it = |{j ∈ F_i | τ_j ≤ t}|  # Citations to focal patent
n_it = |{j ∈ F_k | k ∈ B_i ∪ {i}, τ_j ≤ t}|  # Citations to focal + predecessors

network_factor_i = (1 + density_i) * exp(-γ|N_i|)
quality_factor_i = (k5_i + j5_i) / 2
```
##### 3.2.2.1 Temporal Factor Detail

The temporal factor is defined for a specific patent i at a point in time t:

```python
temporal_factor_it = m_it / n_it

where:
i = index for the focal patent being analyzed
t = observation time point (e.g., years since patent grant)
m_it = number of citations to focal patent i up to time t
n_it = total citations to focal patent i AND its predecessors up to time t
```

##### 3.2.2.1.1 Example
For patent i = "US7123456" at t = 3 years after grant:
```python
m_i3 = 10  # Patent received 10 citations in first 3 years
n_i3 = 20  # Patent + predecessors received 20 citations in first 3 years
temporal_factor_i3 = 10/20 = 0.5
```

##### 3.2.2.1.2 Time Window Considerations
- t typically ranges from 1 to 5 years post-grant
- Longer windows (t > 5) may capture different dynamics
- Early periods (small t) may have more volatility
- Later periods (large t) show stabilized patterns

##### 3.2.2.1.3 Economic Interpretation Over Time
1. **Early Phase (t = 1-2 years)**
   - High volatility in temporal_factor_it
   - Reflects initial market reception
   - May indicate immediate technological impact

2. **Middle Phase (t = 3-5 years)**
   - More stable temporal_factor_it
   - Shows sustained technological influence
   - Better indicates true disruption level

3. **Late Phase (t > 5 years)**
   - Stabilized temporal_factor_it
   - Long-term technological importance
   - May be affected by technological obsolescence

#### 3.2.3 Disruption Index Components
```python
# Traditional Disruption Index
DI_i = (j5_i + i5_i + k5_i) / 3

where:
j5_i = Σ_j∈B_i (1/|B_j|)  # Backward integration
i5_i = 1 - exp(-λ|F_i|)   # Development speed
k5_i = defined above

# Modified Disruption Index
mDI_i = j5_i * (1 + i5_i) * (1 + k5_i)
```

### 3.3 Statistical Properties

#### 3.3.1 Boundary Conditions
```python
0 ≤ temporal_factor_it ≤ 1
0 ≤ network_factor_i ≤ 2
0 ≤ quality_factor_i ≤ 1

0 ≤ DI_i ≤ 1
0 ≤ mDI_i ≤ 4
```

#### 3.3.2 Asymptotic Behavior
For t → ∞:
- temporal_factor_it → steady state if citation patterns stabilize
- network_factor_i → constant as network structure matures
- quality_factor_i → fixed value based on final citation pattern

#### 3.3.3 Time-Weighted Extensions
```python
w_ijt = exp(-β(t - τ_j))  # Time decay weight
weighted_citations_it = Σ_j∈F_i w_ijt
```

### 3.4 Field-Specific Normalization

For technology field f:
```python
normalized_score_if = (score_i - μ_f) / σ_f

where:
μ_f = mean score in field f
σ_f = standard deviation in field f
```

### 3.5 Annual Panel Construction

The panel dataset is constructed from company-level disruption index files, where each observation represents a company-year entry:

```python
{
    'company_name': company,
    'year': int(year),
    'disruption_index': data['disruption_index'],
    'modified_disruption_index': data['modified_disruption_index'],
    'j5_score': data['components']['j5_score'],
    'i5_score': data['components']['i5_score'],
    'k5_score': data['components']['k5_score'],
    'pure_f_score': data['metrics']['pure_f_score'],
    'total_citations': data['metrics']['total_citations'],
    'network_density': data['metrics']['network_density']
}
```

#### 3.5.1 Annual Aggregation Process
1. For each company, we use the grant year of patents as the temporal unit
2. Metrics are calculated at the company-year level directly from the disruption_index.json files
3. No additional temporal aggregation is performed - values represent the metrics for patents granted in that specific year

#### 3.5.2 Key Annual Metrics
- **disruption_index**: Average DI for patents granted that year (j5+i5+k5)/3
- **modified_disruption_index**: Alternative formulation j5*(1+i5)*(1+k5)
- **Component scores** (j5, i5, k5): Direct year-of-grant measures
- **pure_f_score**: Citation matching quality for that year's patents
- **network_density**: Citation network structure for that year's patents

#### 3.5.3 Temporal Coverage
- Full range: 1836-2023
- Each observation represents metrics for patents granted in that specific year
- Recent years may have incomplete citation data due to citation lag

#### 3.5.4 Data Structure
```python
# Yearly averages are calculated as:
yearly_avg = df.groupby('year').agg({
    'disruption_index': 'mean',
    'modified_disruption_index': 'mean',
    'j5_score': 'mean',
    'i5_score': 'mean',
    'k5_score': 'mean',
    'pure_f_score': 'mean',
    'total_citations': 'mean',
    'network_density': 'mean'
})
```
